# RustTutorial
Repo for practicing Rust programming language . Later we can focus on low level programming using Rust on raspberry Pi 
Day -1 
1) cargo new guess_number - 
2)  The above command will create a directory "guess_number" 
3)  Under the directory "guess_number" there is a least of sub folders as below 
    /src  -> Contains main.rs and actual code or the programming language
    /target -> Contains the output executable binary
    /Cargo.toml -> Contains package dependency 
    /Cargo.lock -> 
4) Once the programming logic is implemented , run the program with the command " Cargo run"
